# Getting and Cleaning Data 
# Course Project
    - You should create one script called run_analysis.R.
    - Download https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
    - It should result in a UCI HAR DATASET folder. 
    -Save run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI DATASET.
    
This script should do the following:
    - Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.      
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    - Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
